# Network Implementation in Cisco Packet Tracer

You can find the design of this network here:
https://github.com/dkay7223/Network-Design/blob/main/Solution.pdf

## I. Introduction

This project aims to implement the designed network from Assignment 1 in Cisco Packet Tracer. The network includes DHCP, DNS, a web server (www.name1name2.com), and functional VLANs between different departments.

## II. Network Implementation

### 1. DHCP Configuration

- Implemented DHCP to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices in the network.
- Configured DHCP settings on the router for each VLAN.

### 2. DNS Configuration

- Configured DNS to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
- Set up DNS settings on the router to handle queries for www.name1name2.com.

### 3. Web Server (www.name1name2.com)

- Deployed a web server to host www.name1name2.com.
- Configured routing and access control to allow traffic to the web server.

### 4. Functional VLANs

- Created VLANs for different departments, ensuring network segmentation.
- Configured trunk ports on the router to allow VLAN traffic.

## III. Constraints

- Considered potential constraints, such as bandwidth limitations or hardware restrictions.
- Addressed any constraints by optimizing network configurations.

## IV. Report

### Implementation Overview

- Detailed the step-by-step implementation process.
- Provided screenshots of key configurations.

### Constraints and Optimization

- Discussed any encountered constraints and how they were addressed.
- Ensured optimal network performance within the given constraints.

## V. Report

- The report should contain:
  - Fully Functional Network
  - DHCP Implementation and Functionality
  - DNS Implementation and Functionality
  - Web Server Functionality
  - VLAN Configuration and Functionality

## VI. Cisco Packet Tracer Project File

- Provided a fully functional Cisco Packet Tracer project file.
